# Configure Reverse Proxy Using Nginx

The following is an example on how to set up a reverse proxy using `nginx` for `LTS` for your reference. You can do the configuration yourself as long as you can achieve the requirement which is to redirect requests sent to "https://www.yoursite.com/lts/\*" to "https://127.0.0.1:48080/\*".

## Install nginx

###	On CentOs

* Install

``` shell
rpm -ivh http://nginx.org/packages/centos/7/noarch/RPMS/nginx-release-centos-7-0.el7.ngx.noarch.rpm 
yum install nginx
```

* Start

``` shell
systemctl start nginx.server
```

* Configure the web server to start with the OS

``` shell
systemctl enable nginx.server 
```

### On Ubuntu

``` shell
sudo apt install nginx-full
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

## Test nginx

Open "http://localhost" in a browser. If `nginx` was installed and started successfully, you should see a message like

``` text
······ Welcome to nginx! ······ 
```

## Configure nginx

### Open the configuration file

The file could either be `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` .

### Add your server name

``` shell
server_name www.yoursite.com;
```

### Add reverse proxy

``` shell
location /lts/ {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:48080/;
}
```

### Restart the server

``` shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

At this point, you can access the server with the URL "http://www.yoursite.com/lts/page/index.html#/".

## Configure SSL

For security, we should access the License Tracking Server via HTTPS. For demoing and testing purposes, we can try the self-signed certificate when configuring `nginx` by uncommenting the 3 lines as shown below.

``` shell
server {
	...
	# SSL configuration
	#
	listen 443 ssl default_server;
	listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
	#
	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
	#
	# Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
	#
	# Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
	# Don't use them in a production server!
	#
	include snippets/snakeoil.conf;
  ...
}
```

> NOTE that you shouldn't use self-signed certs in your production server.

After you have configured a secure port, you can then access the server by "https://www.yoursite.com/lts/page/index.html#/".

## Configure the License Tracking Server

With the above steps, the License Tracking Server will be listening on requests sent to this URL "https://www.yoursite.com/lts/". We recommend that you set up another License Tracking Server on another machine as the backup (read more on [configure the LTS as the backup]({{site.selfhosting}}manageLTS.html#configure-a-backup-lts)). Assume the backup URL is "https://backup.yoursite.com/lts/", the following shows how to configure the server to be used (we take the JavaScript edition of Dynamsoft Barcode Reader as an example). Read more information [here]({{site.common}}mechanism.html#configure-lts).

``` javascript
Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeReader.licenseServer = ["https://www.yoursite.com/lts/", "https://backup.yoursite.com/lts/"];
```
